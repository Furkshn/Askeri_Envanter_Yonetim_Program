- **In the past few months, the world has been struggling with the COVID-19. Healthcare professionals sacrifice their own lives to save people from this disease. Unfortunately, millions of people lost their lives due to this disease during the epidemic. There are many ways to protect against coronavirus, but one of the most important things is eating habits.**

<h2 align = "left"> Purpose of the Project :dart: </h2>


- **The USDA Nutrition Policy and Promotion Center recommends the following for a healthy daily diet: 30% grains, 40% vegetables, 10% fruit and 20% protein. However, how many countries or continents can meet this nutritional level ?**

<br> </br>

- **The purpose of this project is to visualize the data in the data set to investigate how much nutrient each continent received in the epidemic and how the nutritional values taken affect the number of deaths and recovery.**

<br> </br>

- **In each of the datasets, the amount of fat, energy intake (kcal), food supply quantity(kg) and protein (all calculated as a percentage of total intake) were calculated for the different food categories. In addition, obesity and undernourished rates (also in percentage) are included in the data set for comparison.** 

<br> </br>
- **The end of the datasets also include the most up to date confirmed/deaths/recovered/active cases (also in percentage of current population for each country).**
